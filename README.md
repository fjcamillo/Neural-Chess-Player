# Neural Chess Player

----

In this project we will create a convolutional neural network that can recognize chess images from a camera angled from the top of the chess board then a fully connected neural network to predict the next move appropriate for the positions on the image

A Convolutional Neural Network best fits the project's goal. Using this Neural Network Architecture would allow us to recognize images seen by the camera setup. The basic idea behind a Convolotuional Neural Network, is to mimic how our brain breaks down the images captires by our eyes which is then abstracted by the gooey stuff in our brain.
